### THEEYETRIBE Company

It all started seven years ago where the four founders met at the IT University of Copenhagen. The ambition was to make eye tracking available for everyone at an affordable price. Within a couple of years they were renowned as the world leading research group in low cost eye tracking. After finishing their PhD’s the four founders bought the IP from the University and formed The Eye Tribe company during their participation in the European StartupBootcamp accelerator program in 2011.

### THE EYE TRIBE TRACKER Description

The Eye Tribe Tracker is an eye tracking system (released in October 2013) that can calculate the location where a person is looking by means of information extracted from person’s face and eyes. The eye gaze coordinates are calculated with respect to a screen the person is looking at, and are represented by a pair of (x, y) coordinates given on the screen coordinate system.
